# Vision AI Project

## Overview
The Vision AI project leverages computer vision and artificial intelligence to analyze images and videos for specific tasks such as object detection, face recognition, and augmented reality. The application is designed to provide real-time, accurate visual insights for various industries like healthcare, agriculture, and retail.

## Features
- **Object Detection**: Detect and classify objects in images or videos.
- **Face Recognition**: Identify and verify faces in real time.
- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Overlay virtual objects on real-world scenes for immersive experiences.
- **Real-time Processing**: Process live video streams with minimal latency.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language for model development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Frameworks for building and training machine learning models.
- **OpenCV**: For real-time image and video processing.
- **Google Colab**: For model training and experimentation.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Dataset
- Custom or publicly available datasets such as COCO, ImageNet, or specific industry datasets.
- Pre-labeled datasets for training object detection and face recognition models.

## Model
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Backbone for image processing tasks.
- **Pretrained Models**: Utilizes models like YOLO, SSD, or ResNet for improved accuracy and faster deployment.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances dataset diversity by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping.
